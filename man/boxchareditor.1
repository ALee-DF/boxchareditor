       To try it go to http://ogt.github.com/boxchareditor and then  use  your
       keyboard arrows to move the yellow cursor around (you may need to click
       on it to give to the window focus).

       When you want to draw a line, keep the SSHHIIFFTT key pressed while you move
       the  arrows.  The  line  will be using the -- dash character to draw the
       line when moving horizontally and the || bar character to draw  vertical
       lines.  Keep  the  SSHHIIFFTT  and CCOOMMMMAANNDD (for macs) or MMEETTAA (for pcs) keys
       pressed to draw a double line using the == equal character.

       When a horizontal and a vertical line cross it uses the ++ plus  charac-
       ter.  There is no undo, but you can erase what you drew by pressing the
       AALLTT key while you move. Erasing is  "smart",  i.e.,  it  looks  at  its
       neighboring  cells  and  fixes anything that need to be fixed after the
       erase.

       Pressing the Restart button does the obvious. There are a few  configu-
       ration  variables  that you can change - you will need to press Restart
       for them to take effect. One of the configuration variables is ssppeeeedd  -
       speed 2 means that a any arrow key pressed is repeated 2 times - so the
       moving/drawing happens faster.

       The drawing happens against an invisible canvas - you control the width
       and height of it through configuration parameters. You cannot draw out-
       side the canvas. For fonts you shoud  probably  stick  to  fixed  width
       fonts.

       The  purpose  of  the  utility is to allow you to draw relative complex
       tables/org charts that you then copy and paste into your editor.

       To run locally:



           > hub clone ogt/boxchareditor && cd boxchareditor
           > npm install
           > open index.html



       To make local changes:



           > hub clone ogt/boxchareditor && cd boxchareditor
           > npm install
           > # make any changes you want
           > make bundle  #recreates static/bundle.js
           > make test # confirm tests run fine
           > open index.html



       To recreate the man page (if you don't have ruby's  bbuunnddllee  ggeemm  iinnssttaall
       bbuunnddllee first)



           > bundle install
           > make man



       To get coverage report



           > make cover
           > open cover_html/index.html



       To run lint based on the included ..jjssiinniittrrcc spec



           > make lint



       To run the tap tests



           > make test # or just npm test



       Its  a  good  idea  to run mmaakkee aallll or just mmaakkee before pushing to make
       sure that everything has been updated. If you want an enhancement  feel
       free to add an issue to github.com/ogt/boxchareditor
